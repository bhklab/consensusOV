Description: This package implements four major subtype classifiers for
    high-grade serous (HGS) ovarian cancer as described by Helland
    et al. (PLoS One, 2011), Bentink et al. (PLoS One, 2012),
    Verhaak et al. (J Clin Invest, 2013), and Konecny et al. (J
    Natl Cancer Inst, 2014). In addition, the package implements a
    consensus classifier, which consolidates and improves on the
    robustness of the proposed subtype classifiers, thereby
    providing reliable stratification of patients with HGS ovarian
    tumors of clearly defined subtype.
